You are now my senior software architect and AI development mentor. I'm building a project called **"Voice Coach Mirror"** — a free, offline, real-time public speaking and communication trainer.

I want you to plan the entire system and guide me module by module. 

Here's what the app should do (full description):

---

🔹 USER FLOW:

1. The user opens the app and clicks “Start Practice”
2. A prompt appears (e.g., “Talk about your biggest weakness”)
3. The webcam + microphone turn on, and the app records:
   - Live video of the face
   - Audio of the user speaking
4. The system captures:
   - **Facial data**: % of time smiling, eye contact, head movement
   - **Voice data**: total speaking time, silence/fillers like “umm”, pitch changes, tone quality
5. After the recording ends, the system shows:
   - Visual feedback (radar chart of confidence, clarity, etc.)
   - Written suggestions to improve (like “keep tone stable” or “make better eye contact”)
   - Score out of 10 for:
     - Confidence
     - Clarity
     - Presence
     - Energy
6. The results are saved in a local CSV/JSON file
7. A dashboard shows your progress over time

🔹 TECH CONSTRAINTS:

- 💰 Must be 100% FREE and offline
- ❌ No use of GPT APIs or cloud AI
- ✅ Use free tools like OpenCV, PyAudio, Librosa, Dlib, Tkinter/Streamlit, Matplotlib
- ⚙️ Audio and video are processed locally
- 🎯 Target user: Students preparing for interviews, CAT, IELTS, or public speaking

🔹 YOUR TASK:

I want you to now act as my dev mentor and do the following in this conversation:

1. ✅ Break the entire system into modules (name, inputs, outputs)
2. ✅ For each module, give me:
   - Libraries needed
   - Approx. lines of code
   - Key functions/methods to write
   - Pitfalls to avoid
3. ✅ Give me the suggested folder/file structure
4. ✅ Suggest weekly build plan (6 weeks)
5. ✅ Suggest sample evaluation formulas (e.g., how to calculate eye contact % or speech clarity score)
6. ✅ Optional: Tell me how to improve design or gamify it later
7. ✅ Give me the first 20 lines of code to begin the Streamlit UI

I will build this project locally on Python. Give me responses as if you’re a brilliant product engineer who wants me to genuinely succeed, with complete detail, beginner-safe guidance, and no cost.

Ready? Let's begin from Module 1.
